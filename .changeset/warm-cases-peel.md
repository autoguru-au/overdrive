This release updates the visual appearance of the following components: Button,
Checkbox, Radio, Switch, TextInput, NumberInput, DateInput, ColourInput,
AutoSuggest, Select, Tabs and Table. A consistent keyboard focus outline has
also been applied and addresses a few accessibility issues relating to labelling
on Button and aria attributes on Checkbox, Radio and Tabs.

Input fields: TextInput, NumberInput, DateInput, Select, and AutoSuggest now
have `large` size via the shared InputBase.

Tabs: A new `appearance` prop has been added to configure a Pill look-and-feel.

Button: Addition of size `xsmall`.

Checkbox: Added support for an indeterminate state.
