This release updates the visual appearance of the following components: Button,
Checkbox, Radio, Switch, TextInput, NumberInput, DateInput, ColourInput, Tabs
and Auto Suggest. A consistent keyboard focus outline has also been applied and
addresses a few accessibility issues relating to labelling on Button and aria
attributes on Checkbox, Radio and Tabs.
