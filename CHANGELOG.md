## 2.0.11

### Patch Changes

-   358fb4b: Tabs: Incorrectly importing treat files inside treat

## 2.0.10

### Patch Changes

-   0b6c621: Tabs: Adds `scrollable`, which scrolls the tabs horizontally on
    smaller devices.

    **FEATURES**

    ```jsx
    <Tabs>
    	<TabList scrollable>
    		<Tab>This</Tab>
    		<Tab>Tab</Tab>
    		<Tab>Might</Tab>
    		<Tab>Scroll</Tab>
    	</TabList>
    </Tabs>
    ```

-   729dfdd: Input: Notchless inputs will no longer break when part of a flex
    container

## 2.0.9

### Patch Changes

-   0b59110: Flatten fragments when provided as children

    Will now support fragments and otherwise boolean children that previously
    would not have worked:

    ```jsx
    <Stack>
    	<p>line 0</p>
    	{isEnabled && (
    		<>
    			<p>Line 1</p>
    			<p>Line 2</p>
    			<p>Line 3</p>
    		</>
    	)}
    	<p>line 4</p>
    </Stack>
    ```

    > which would have the past not had lines 1-3 spaced evenly.

    this was also true for: `Actions`, `Inline`, `TabList`, `TabPanes` and
    `Stack`. Which have been rectified.

## 2.0.8

### Patch Changes

-   55ee559: Positioner: Removes usingPositioner

    **FEATURES**

    Removes the usingPositioner HoC in favour of a plain-old component that'll
    gives us the ability to send _all_ our Box props onto it. It also aids in
    corrected aria-\* props.

## 2.0.7

### Patch Changes

-   b9a2c45: InputBase: Allow for notchless inputs

    **FEATURES**

    Sometimes the notch behavior won't work because of its context - much like
    an input that sits within a table, where the column already denotes what
    should be entered into the input.

    > Please be aware that this should be avoided, as in most cases we should
    > notch, so a user knows what's in the input especially when its defaulted.

-   7736914: Box: Adds an overflow prop and allows className to be clsx
    compatible

    **FEATURES**

    `ClassName` can now be sent in directly to Box instead of through clsx.

    eg.

    ```diff
    - <Box className={clsx(styles.one, styles.two)}>
    + <Box className={[styles.one, styles.two]}>
        Hello
    </Box>

    - <Box className={clsx({[styles.one]: maybeDoMe}, styles.two)}>
    + <Box className={[{[styles.one]: maybeDoMe}, styles.two]}>
        Hello
    </Box>
    ```

-   17d2354: Stack: Expose the Box width on Stack
-   475601c: Tabs: Now always fills the width of its parent

## 2.0.6

### Patch Changes

-   d1c6b09: responsiveProps: Fix argument where void is not the same as
    undefined

## 2.0.5

### Patch Changes

-   4df7e83: AutoSuggest: Introduce a autoWidth prop that either will size the
    flyout to either the width of the children, or the input.

    **FEATURES**

    `<AutoSuggest>` can now be given a `autoWidth` prop that will auto the width
    in relation to setting the width, or for it to be automatic.

    -   `autoWidth={true}` means, size the flyout to the width of flyout
        children "automatically"
    -   `autoWidth={false}` means to set to the width of the select input.

    eg:

    ```jsx

    // size to the width of the flyout children
    <AutoSuggest
        placeholder="How are you?"
        suggestions={[{ text: "Im an item" }]}
        autoWidth
    />

    // size to the width of the input (current behaviour)
    <AutoSuggest
        placeholder="How are you?"
        suggestions={[{ text: "Im an item" }]}
    />

    ```

-   378e5da: AutoSuggest: Input search types to remove the webkit clear button

    **FEATURES**

    When we reset input type searches, we incorrectly "hid" the webkit search
    buttons, this aims to correct that.

-   eb3cf9d: AutoSuggest: Support the usage of passing a ref down to the
    implemented input

    **FEATURES**

    `<AutoSuggest>` can now be given a ref which will be passed down to the
    underlying input.

    eg:

    ```tsx
    const myRef = useRef<HTMLInputElement | null>(null);

    <AutoSuggest ref={myRef} value={null} placeholder={'My AutoSuggest'} />;
    ```

-   bab9cd2: InputBase: Always full width the input wrapper

## 2.0.4

### Patch Changes

-   801c254: Positioner: Uses Popper.js to run the flyouts.

    **FEATURES**

    **`<Positioner />`** uses Popper.js, as it offers a wide array of
    performance improvements and caters for some edge-cases, like when the'yre
    nested etc.

    Few stats: we use popper-lite which is rated at 3.73Kb minified and
    compressed. Now getOptimalPosition was about 1.3Kb minified and compressed.
    However, it had a few holes, and when I looked at what it'll take to
    implement the features to solve the holes - we'd probably still beat the
    file size, but not by much...

    So with that once internal bandwidth increase this'll likely be revisited -
    and perhaps utilize `detectOverflow` as a roll-your-own solution.

-   0964a1d: useNegativeMargin: Correctly fill columns to their parents width

    **BUG FIXES** Columns were not completely filling its parent due to negative
    margins

## 2.0.3

### Patch Changes

-   15f486c: Modals: Now uses a shared `<Portal />` component.

    **FEATURES**

    **`<Portal />`** component allowing for shared Portaling of components to
    inside a container.

    Responsibility: Rendering a child into a container, which by default is
    `window.body`.

    eg:

    ```jsx
    // Input
    <div>
        some sibling
        <Portal>
            <div>my child</div>
        </Portal>
    </div>

    // Result
    <body>
        <div>some sibling>
        <div>my child</div>
    </body>
    ```

    **`<Modal />`** is in charge of handling a backdrop - which also directly
    uses the new `<Portal>` component.

    Responsibility: Renders a child into a Portal, with a backdrop and correct
    aria attributes applied.

    You can give this component `hideBackdrop?: boolean` prop to disable the
    backdrop. Also; if you wish to remove the fadeIn/fadeOut animation, a
    `transition?: boolean` can also be provided.

    -   Removes `<ModalPortal />` in favor of `<Modal />`
    -   Deprecated `withModal`, which could simply just use the Modal component

    Worth noting that a `role="presentation"` is applied to the `Modal`, so
    consumers should be applying a `role="none presentation"` to their direct
    parent, if you wish content to be read out.

    eg:

    ```jsx
    <Modal isOpen={true} onRequestClose={function() {}}>
    	<div>some content</div>
    </Modal>
    ```

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

-   6c3ae76: Tabs: Support stretching tablist items to the width of the
    container

    **FEATURES**

    **`<TabList />`**

    In small contexts, like sidebars, or mobile viewports with minimal tablist
    items. It makes sense to stretch items to meet the width of the container.

    eg:

    ```
    <Tabs>
        <TabList stretch>
            <Tab>Tab a</Tab>
            <Tab>Tab b</Tab>
        </TabList>
    </Tabs>
    ```

-   302405b: Alert: Inline is now full width

    **Features**

    `<Alert />`

    When passing the `inline` prop, in the past it was maxWidth 640px - which in
    inline contexts, you'd want to span the entire width of its container.

-   3bcf649: Adds the Inline and Section layout components

    **Features**

    Breakpoints have been amended to follow (mobile first):

    -   `tablet` is iPad Mini width less 25%, so any device greater than 768px
    -   `desktop` we are considering as iPad Pro width less 25%, so any device
        larger than 1024px
    -   `largeDesktop` is taken as a 1920x1080 less 25%, so any device larger
        than 1440px

    all at landscape.

    **`<Inline />`**

    When you're wanting to `inline` something. Like a badge list; you can use
    use the `<Inline />` component to solve this.

    eg:

    ```jsx
    <Inline>
    	<Badge colour="green" label="Success" />
    	<Badge colour="red" label="Danger" />
    	<Badge colour="blue" label="Information" />
    </Inline>
    ```

    **`<Section />`**

    A component that wraps its children, setting a `max-width` and centering on
    the screen. This will generally sit high up in the component tree. It offers
    2 widths `medium` and `large`. The medium width is intended for smaller more
    concise layouts - like our Afterpay landing, or Uber landing. Were as the
    `large` will probably be more for our Leads or Bookings list screens.

    When coupled with `Columns` we effectively have a full fletched layout
    system, that can ü§∑‚Äç replace our `ContainedLayout` and `ContentOnlyLayout`
    internal components.

    To solve the `ThreeColumnLayout` and `TwoColumnLayout` we can build internal
    abstractions that extend this perhaps.

    eg:

    ```jsx
    <Section width="medium" paddingX={['3', , 'none']}>
    	<Columns space="3">
    		<Column width="2/3">...</Column>
    		<Column width="1/3">...</Column>
    	</Columns>
    </Section>
    ```

-   f9dac97: Inline: Supporting alignY responsive prop StarRating: Consumes
    `<Inline />`

    **FEATURES**

    **`<Inline />`**

    Now supports an alignY responsive prop to vertically center its items to
    either `top | center | bottom`, eg: `<Inline alignY="center">`

    **`<StarRating />`**

    Uses the `<Inline />` component instead of columns, so should use less DOM

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

-   c66b727: Anchors are now cursor pointer by default

    Seeing as we use `<TextLink />` or `<Box is="a" href="" />` in a few places,
    it only makes sense to use `a { cursor: pointer }`.

-   57b8cf3: Actions now filters out undefined or null children

    **`<Actions />`**

    Removed the className prop, this will slowly start happening across the
    stack.

    ```diff
    -<Actions className="test">
    +<Actions>
        ...
    </Actions>
    ```

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

-   8881bdd: Styles are now `treat` driven.

    **A few changes**

    -   `OverdriveProvider` must now be provider
    -   `ToastProvider` must also be provided when using a `useToast`
    -   `@autoguru/overdrive/reset` must be given first.

    ... and a whole series of other things. Please consult to the PR (#273) to
    get a better idea of what's changed.
